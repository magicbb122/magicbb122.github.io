<p> 原来大黄猫是想学竹笛的，上课之后，突然发现，竹笛的声音实在是很嘹亮。
    如果猫可以用小手指堵耳朵孔的话，他们一定会那么做的。
    试过了把猫关书房里，把自己关书房或者洗手间里，或者骗猫到衣橱里。。。
    现在有了个折中的方法了，大黄猫开始学习洞箫了！洞箫声音悠远低沉，连猫也接受。

    <br>
    <br>
    在wiki找到了些洞箫的英语介绍，觉得很直接和简洁。

    <i>The Xiao,is a Chinese vertical end-blown flute. It is generally made of bamboo. It is also sometimes called dòngxiāo,
    dong meaning "hole".
    Xiao blowing hole (the hole faces away from the player, against the lower lip, making sure the top lip is not concealing the hole, 
    when the instrument is played. Works on the same basics as blowing air over an empty bottle to create noise.)</i>

    <i>Xiao are today most often pitched in the key of G (with the D above middle C being the lowest note, with all fingers covered), 
    although xiao in other less common keys are also available, most commonly in the key of F. More traditional xiao have six finger holes, 
    while most modern ones have eight; the additional holes do not extend the instrument's range but instead make it easier to play notes such as F natural.
    There are a further four (sometimes two or six) sound holes situated at the bottom third of the length of the xiao. The blowing hole is at the top end, 
    it may be cut into a 'U' shape, a "V" shape, or at an angle (with or without bone/ivory inlay.) 
    The length of the xiao ranges from around 45 cm to over 1.25 m but is usually around 75–85 cm. Usually, shorter xiaos are more difficult to play because of the need to control one's breath more accurately. 
    he angle to play the xiao is around 45 degrees from the body.</i>
